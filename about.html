                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded by Sam Encina, a business-minded entrepreneur with a passion for innovation, Rhapid was born from a simple observation: the ride-sharing industry could be better. While existing services offered convenience, they often lacked flexibility, transparency, and a genuine focus on the well-being of both riders and drivers. Sam envisioned a platform where users could choose their driver, drivers could set their own terms, and everyone could feel safer and more connected.</p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is to revolutionize the personal transportation industry by providing a platform that prioritizes choice, fairness, and community. We aim to empower our drivers to be their own bosses and to provide our riders with a safe, reliable, and highly personalized experience. By this time next year, we plan to be the go-to choice for personal drivers in Austin, Houston, and Dallas, with a goal of driving $450,000 in annual revenue.</p>

            <h2>The Rhapid Advantage</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">We're not just another ride-share app. Here's how we're different.</p>
            <div class="why-grid">
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Empowering Drivers</h4>
                    <p>Drivers set their own rates and keep a larger portion of the fare. We take a fair 15% commission, compared to the 25% or more taken by competitors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Unprecedented Rider Choice</h4>
                    <p>Riders can browse detailed driver profiles, including ratings, vehicle information, and customer reviews, before booking a ride.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>The "Fleet" Feature</h4>
                    <p>A future innovation where drivers can team up to form their own "fleets," creating a business-within-a-business on our platform.</p>

            <h2>Our Market</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">We're targeting a new generation of riders and drivers who value flexibility, safety, and community.</p>
            <div class="market-info">
                <p>The ride-share market is massive, with millions of Americans relying on these services daily. However, a large portion of this market, particularly young adults and millennials, are seeking better, safer, and more personalized alternatives. This is where Rhapid comes in. Our target audience includes college students, young professionals, and anyone who has felt underserved by the one-size-fits-all approach of our competitors.</p>
